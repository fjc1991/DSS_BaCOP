Tired of not finding the right oil/scent, we decided to make our own. With years of gaming and beard ownership experience, we use that as inspiration for this product line. We are turning to Kickstarter to acquire the funds necessary to start this grooming company. With the Kickstarter funds we hope to bring our brand and our product to life. Expansion is one of our goals as well, as we hope to bring other product lines to life. The Product:  A custom blend of oils meant to nourish and soften your beard. Using unique combinations of both fragrance and essential oils we bring the scents of different game worlds to life. We are starting off small with three unique scents that we believe stay true to their origins. 1 Up Grooming company is not tested on animals.  The Brand: Games and their worlds are the main inspiration behind this company. With so many different characters, worlds, and stories it is easy for us to find new ideas for products and scents. We hope to bring these game worlds to life via the scents we create.  Why Beard Oil? Everyone has to start out somewhere, and the choice we made was beard oil. This was because not only does one of us have a beard, but many other people do as well. We hope to bring unique game inspired scents to the world. If successful we could also easily bring these scents into other products, for men and women. Stretch Goals: If we meet our goal and go beyond it we will have the capability to create even more scents. If we double our goal we can even bring out a new product line.","We know the gaming community is a passionate one, and we hope to satisfy it with the scents we create, although we understand that everyone's nose is different.

In our eyes the vulture represents a scavenger, but in this case it is seeking vegetarian food. The moonlight in the name refers to being open later at night and having a calm, quiet atmosphere.  Moonlight Vulture, our sandwich shop in Logan Square, Chicago, is launching on the slimmest of margins, true to its vulture roots. We have secured the space and have begun demolition.  2889 N. Milwaukee Ave. is along a historic and thriving corridor, and we wish to contribute to the community by offering residents and visitors delicious fare. Our build out and initial start up costs are just over 7K, and in the scope of what we need, the Kickstarter is only a fraction, but a very important fraction. As we are not getting a conventional bank loan the $1, will be a vital part of our success.  The Kickstarter funds will enable Moonlight Vulture greater creativity, which is necessary for the environment we wish to cultivate.   It helps that we have experience in this business and understand that the greatest asset we have is our own labor and dedication. Taking part in the entire process, from demolition to cooking, we will be saving labor costs and working the long, long shifts, because it's a dream of ours. Your Kickstarter help is important!  Moonlight Vulture will rise with a very shoe-string approach and we appreciate you checking out our dream. Not only is food a creative endeavor, but the right atmosphere brings together creative individuals who need nourishment and healthy food to keep their vital selves running later into the evening. ","The risk of opening a food establishment is one the highest but we have made great progress already and are lined up well to continue with the plans in place. The most important gift we have is vision, to see beyond the present and realize the future state of things.   There will be setbacks. Luckily, experience has taught us to stay focused on the solution to any given problem, and ask for help when we need it. One of the biggest challenges will be practicing a new menu in a new kitchen and delivering our art (sandwiches and food) in a timely manner.  Enthusiasm is something we bring everyday to this project. We are very excited and never forget this is a learning process. It's taking a team of people to launch Moonlight Vulture, and we're getting great help and support-- thank you to everyone. ",success

many hours do you spend backing up & sorting photos every month? Do you have trouble sharing photos in the same house between iOS and Android? If life means more memories and photos. Why should Cloud monthly costs go up? Those Cloud data breaches are happening more and more frequent aren't they? Capsule brings Cloud like convenience - automatic photo and video backup plus access anywhere, with the added benefit of safe & unlimited storage of photos in your house, and no monthly fees!  Best of all, it helps you enjoy your memories more with automatic album and slideshow creation! How Capsule Works Skip ahead Instant Photo backup to your home | Automatic Photo sorting & Search | Unlimited Storage | Automatic Photo Sharing | RAW Image Support Beta Users After 2 years of testing & building Capsule, it's working and helping other families to backup & relive their memories. Watch the video below to hear what a few of our Beta-user families have to say: Our 12 smart, good looking, and happy Beta users As seen on  Note: ""Photos"" above refer to both Photos and Videos. It Just Works Capsule takes 3 minutes to setup and works seamlessly with your phone. Just plug it in, download the Capsule app on your phone, tablet or computer, and you're good to go. No need to fiddle with IP addresses or LAN setups. The Capsule hardware works by communicating directly with Capsule app on your mobile, tablet or computer via your home internet. This Capsule app is your gateway to photos & videos. It's used to backup, plus gives access to your photos, videos, slideshows, etc. Capsule app is available everywhere Capsule backs up to any existing hard drives you have - regardless of size or format (Windows, Mac, Linux). If you have multiple hard drives with photos & videos. Plug them all in via a USB hub. All photos & videos on those drives are instantly available on your Capsule App. No upload necessary! One Capsule is enough for a household of any size. The video below shows the steps to set up Capsule: Instant photo backup Take a photo with the camera app you currently use on your iPhone or Android, anywhere in the world and Capsule backs it up to the Capsule hardware in your home happily, instantly, auto-magically ;) The Capsule app on your mobile phone runs in the background and works 24x7 to backup any photos you take, anywhere. If you are short on mobile data, this feature could be turned off, and Capsule will instead backup automatically when your smartphone is on (any) WiFi. This instant backup feature means if phone gets smashed, lost, or water damaged in the last wash circle. Your cherished memories are already backed up! Backup from everywhere We want Capsule to be the one place where all your cherished memories lives. Plug in any device and the photos or videos will be instantly available on your phone, tablet, or computer. No need to wait for photos & videos to upload! Here's what you get with Capsule when it backs up from Social or Cloud apps you use: Got a NAS at home? Capsule will back up your photos & videos to that instead of an external hard drive. Capsule will also allow you access to all your photos & videos on your NAS. WiFi Backup Speed Our Beta Users have seen their entire collection of 15, photos or videos from their phone + iCloud back up to Capsule in less than 3 nights (while charging overnight). Photos Sorted for you Capsule actually understands what's in your photo or video. It recognizes people, location, events, even objects.  Because Capsule doesn't treat photos or videos as files, but as important memories, it's able to curate your photos & videos in a way that means the most to you! Our smart AI is applied to every single photos or video Capsule touches. Including the ones you backup from Facebook, Dropbox, Instagram etc. In addition we began collating your memories into Albums and Slideshows as we backup. Bringing even more life to your favorite moments!  Video below shows how a Capsule Album is just like a real (reel :D) Album Photo Search Want to find that single photo to rejig your memory, or add to a photo album? Use the search function in the Capsule App on any of your devices to locate your favorite memories by people, location or events. On our desktop app, you can export or drag the search result into a folder for processing & printing. Photo Search on the Capsule Mac Desktop                                                                                                                                                                              Unlimited Mobile Space Photos & Videos takes up most of the space on your phone. Because Capsule stores your photos & videos at home, and only streams them to your mobile as you need them. It frees up the space on your phone for other things. Note: For photos & videos that you view frequently, the Capsule app does store a copy on your phone for quick access, which you could always remove from your phone Settings.  Unlimited Photo Storage What if you're running low on hard drive space at home? After buying a bigger hard drive, plug your old smaller hard drive into the ""Camera"" / Extraction USB port, the new hard drive into the backup USB port. Capsule will automatically move all the photos & videos over from the older, smaller hard drive, to the new and bigger one - that's why Capsule comes with 2 USB ports! (one IN and one OUT) Sharing & Slideshow curation Capsule was built from the ground up for sharing. Sharing with friends on Facebook, WeChat, SMS? Just select a photo or video from within the Capsule all, and choose which application you want share it on. No more fiddling with other apps. Sharing with people in the same house? Capsule works best if you allow it to sync everyone's photos - but it's an option you can set up: either set Capsule to sync everything. Everyone in the house backs up, and has access to the same pool of photos & videos e.g. when photos arrive from your partners' phone, you will see it. Capsule will notify you, and automatically generated slideshows & accompanying music OR set Capsule to have separate buckets. Everyone in the house backup their photos & videos to the same hard drive. But you can't see each other's photos. With ""sync everything"" set, this is what happens on Johnathan's phone when Capsule detects new photos taken by his wife. See video below: Sharing photos with a love one who don't live in the same house? You can set up a rule to have Capsule automatically share the photos, videos or Albums with your love ones who don't live with you. When new photos or albums match the rule, people you share with will automatically be notified, and can access the photos or albums. Sharing rules can be any combination of: people in photo (e.g. share all photos that have my daughter in them) taken at specific location (e.g. share all photos I take at work) taken by a specific person (e.g. share all photos that I took) taken during a specific time period (e.g. share photos taken last year) Best of all, it's FREE - people (outside of your household) who you share photo with don't need to own the Capsule hardware to be a part of your life, even if they live half way around the world. Camera RAW Image Support In 218, we plan to add RAW image support to Capsule. This should allow you to:  backup all RAW files (e.g. TIFF) in their original format from iPhone, Camera etc directly into Capsule view the RAW files on all your devices download the RAW file in either compressed format (format to be confirmed) or RAW format to any of your devices - e.g. download RAW files to your computer via the Capsule Desktop app for your Photoshop workflow  It gets better It literally does. We realise that you don't buy for the present, you buy for the future. All of our software updates by itself and will continue to receive new updates regularly. This means even your Capsule hardware will get smarter, better and faster over time - just ask our Beta users who have been receiving weekly updates from us since July! Best of all. There are no monthly fees. You pay once for the Capsule hardware, and get access to the Capsule apps everywhere you are for FREE. We love choice and know that you do too. That's why Capsule comes in 2 Editions - Metal and Standard. Each edition also has 2 color choices. All 4 Capsules are equally awesome at keeping your cherished memories safe. Pick an Edition and color that best matches your home decor! Capsule Metal Edition Carved out of a solid block of premium grade Aluminium utilising CNC machining. Sandblasted and polished to a Matte finish. If you enjoy the sleek and futuristic look of Apple products, or just something that's always cool to touch (pun intended). This one's for you! We use similar material and production method as the Apple Macbook™ for our Metal Capsules.  Note: Backplate design will be improved during mass production. Capsule Standard Edition Made from high quality ABS plastic. Injection molded and employing a Satin Matte finish. Logos created as separate pieces and embedded into the main body, to give it that subtle 3D look (look closely at the front on shot of the Arctic White). Logo color in neon green (on Arctic White) or white (on Midnight Black). Great for those that want an understated, yet modern look.   Note: Backplate design will be improved during mass production.  Thank you for believing in our vision. To get your hands on a Capsule, please pick one or more of the following Rewards today! Note: we will contact you after Kickstarter ends to confirm your preference of colors in Capsule Standard (non-Metal) or Capsule Metal Editions. Note 2: There may be slight differences to the price you pay vs. the  prices you see below. Our campaign was created in AUD. Kickstarter may convert the price to your local currency, subjected to daily exchange rate fluctuations. The Capsule team shares the mission to make reliving your memories effortless and enjoyable. We have a truly diverse and multi-cultural team, hailing from Europe, Asia, and Oceania. This diversity gives us the insight to challenge the status quo. 7 languages and how every many dialects late, English and a penchant for all thing Design & Tech has become our common language :D We are no strangers to designing & shipping software and electronics of all types.  Together the team has close to 55 years of experience doing exactly that. Our experience spans product, design, software and hardware engineering.  We believe an unrelenting focus on design and quality will produce a product that last through the ages... from concept to end product exploring other Capsule material, design, finishing and color combinations The journey thus far... It started over 2 years ago.... Due to a failed backup, I (Johnathan) lost 4 months worth of videos chronicling many of my daughter's firsts - from her first drink out of a sippy cup, to her first teddy bear, to even her first step. This got me thinking about why photo & video back ups are so difficult in the 21st century. The only viable option left to us seem to be manually backing up our photos, or trust our photos to the Cloud companies that takes over rights to our memories. Despite working in Technology, I wasn't comfortable handing over my precious memories to a Cloud storage company that routinely scans my family photos in order to market to us, then rents our memories back to us at a monthly fee. After trying a bunch of products on the market and finding no company cared enough to solve this problem, I decided to take matters into my own hands... In designing Capsule, we made a deliberate decision to keep your data in your home, not on our servers. This includes where your photos & videos are stored, the data generated by our AI, even how sharing is managed. After all, these are your cherished memories, your life. You own them and have all the rights to them. Not us. Anton, Pece and I started Capsule because of our belief that a product like this needs to exist with your interest in mind.  We've been funding development of the product the past 2 years with our own savings. We use Capsule in our own homes, and have seen it help other families. Nothing would give us more joy than to be able to ship this product to you in the next couple of months! That's where you come in! We have lined up suppliers both locally and overseas. But in order to bring Capsule to you, we need your help to pay for tooling and manufacturing. Storing your favourite moments in a safe and accessible manner was a challenge till now. You've had to choose between manually backing up, or putting it on the Cloud to risk your privacy and security. With Capsule you can have both! Help us make Capsule a reality. Reserve a Capsule for you or your family by clicking on the Big Green button below!  Thanks for reading up to this point, here's how Capsule is different - paying homage to the Mac vs. PC Ads of the 2s, with the help of Thor's hammer :D  Enjoy!","Producing a hardware product is never easy, but we are confident in our ability to deliver this project on time and with great quality.  We've done everything we could to reduce the risk for our backers including: • a diverse & experienced team to deliver Capsule • taking the hardware & software product all the way to Beta with our own money  • iterating and testing the product relentlessly for the last 2 years  In addition we've completed small trial production runs with our manufacturing partners in Australia and overseas, allowing us to see first hand how the production process would look at scale as well as early indication of problem areas.  Capsule embodies a (patented) unique shape, and is more difficult to produce ""brick-like” electronics and TV set up boxes. Over the course of 5 or so production iterations, we have worked through most of the major issues.   Keep in mind that there are always issues that could arise, which we may not have anticipated. We've factored into the timeline additional buffers just in case, and we'll be totally transparent and forthcoming with what those are, and get you, the community involved as much as possible.  Despite that, our target delivery date is end of May 2018. We would love to ship earlier and will do everything we can to make this happen.   We are totally committed to making Capsule a product that lasts, is beautiful, and Just Works. ",failed

Our software allows users to connect with different cloud providers and stripe their data across multiple servers. This ensures data will not to be jeopardized if a server has a breach of security.  How it works Cryptostripe's algorithm works to split your files into multiple indecipherable pieces that can only be restored through the use of our system. Cryptostripe also allows for free cloud storage limits to be maximized, by splitting the data and storing it across multiple storage servers we are giving you the ability to store more with only a portion of your data saved on any given cloud server the storage limits can be summed together to get your real storage capacity.  By separating the uploaded data into multiple segments users will be able to upload data safely and securely onto their favorite cloud storages without the risk of any third party intrusions. We at strive to be the leading provider in consumer based data encryption and security. Working with some of the most well known data cloud storage services Cryptostripe adds the extra layer of security for our users to protect any data they choose to upload.  Why are we building it? More than anything we wish to provide our users with the safety and peace of mind they desire by protecting their personal information and data from prying eyes around the world. As we move forward more and more of our lives and personal information become digitized, the convenience of putting all of our information into the hands of companies on “the cloud” is training us to casually sacrifice our privacy and fragment our online identities. Not long ago in 212 one of the most notable cloud storage breaches took place involving the popular storage site Dropbox. This story along with many others that have take place since have all motivated our team to create a safer environment to store data on these cloud storage sites. Very recently we also learned that the number of people affected by the hack in 212 was much larger than Dropbox either thought or than what they wanted us all to know. Whether Dropbox knew or whether they decided that everyone didn’t deserve full disclosure their users lost that feeling of safety and security and were put at risk. Even more recently consumers have learned of the massive data breach on the popular website Yahoo. This sort of intrusion into privacy is becoming a much more common issue that has the potential to cause harm to many. In order to restore that feeling of security we at Cryptostripe want to put an end to our users lack of privacy. After the countless data breaches and government data seizures we decided that consumers needed a way to store their data knowing 1% that they would be the only ones with access to it, and so we set out to build just that. *See Listing on the Right for Full Reward Details* *All Reward Designs TBD* Pledge $3 or more Cryptostripe T-Shirt *Design TBD*  Pledge $55 or more (includes above rewards) 8gb USB Flash Drive *Design TBD*  Pledge $15 or more (includes above rewards) Bluetooth Headphones *Design TBD* Our progress so far Recently we have improved our website to add more user interface and become much more visually appealing. While it has improved we still continue to work everyday on ways to make it better.  With our program being functional and linked to three cloud storages we are currently in a limited Alpha stage of testing working on getting rid of any bugs and potential security threats. We are also working with white hat hackers in order to find more security vulnerabilities in our system. We intend on having a public beta for all of our backers ready by November 216 and use the input of our beta testers to make the site more user friendly, add new features, and become even more secure. What will the funds be used for? The money that you have pledged (which we are so very thankful for) will help to bring our idea of secure cloud storage to life. We have the ideas and ability to bring this product to the people, what we really need is the time to accomplish our goal. Your pledges will give us the ability to put in much more time into fulfilling our promise.  Along with giving us more time to work on Cryptostripe your funds will go towards basic costs that are required to run and maintain our servers and website. They will also be used to further progress our security through the hiring of security experts in order to analyze any and all weaknesses and further build the program out of Alpha stage. Lastly these pledges will go towards overhauling our website both in user interface as well as optimization. Currently we have done most of the coding for both the website and application, with your help we hope to bring on one or two more excellent programmers to further excel our goals.  Want more info?

","When developing something completely new, unforeseen circumstances do tend to arise. Yet, we are confident that we have made all preparations to follow-up on the promises we’ve made on our campaign page. With a working program and website developed and testing successfully, we feel we are ready to enter our Alpha stage. To facilitate our users, we are currently simplifying the design and working on our interface. The designs of the different rewards offered for our pledges have yet to be decided, but we will share with our backers as soon as it is confirmed. Should we come across any deviations in our schedule we will be sure to inform you promptly so that you can follow along with our development! ",failed

Set in a magical world of vivid and imaginative characters, Moji Moji develops children’s literacy skills in a way that is fun, artistic, and playful, and allows parents to personalize their child’s experience with tools and insights to participate in meaningful screen time. Hidden within six immersive worlds; from the tropical jungle to the marshy swamp, children interact with the lively characters through tracing and spelling challenges. By transforming the letters of the alphabet into their energetic animal counterparts players exercise their motor, auditory, and phonics skills at varying difficulty levels to progress through the worlds. Parents can feel empowered to personalize and monitor their child’s digital exposure by managing screen time and difficulty settings in Parent Mode. They can track their child’s development through engagement insights, accuracy statistics, and even real-time recordings of letters traced. Why are we raising funds? Moji Moji has been in development since 216 and we're super close to launch. The funds raised on Kickstarter will help fuel the project across the finish line, be used to cover the production of your reward, and if there's anything left, we'll reinvest into the team to improve the app for many versions to come, along with R&D into the next release from Gakko Digital Learning. If you choose to back the project, we'd be honored to have you be part of our mission to help early learners thrive regardless of age or ability, to make screen time meaningful, and to empower parents with insights into their child's development. Reward Details: Letter Flashcards We hope you love the design and craft of Moji Moji as much as we do, so we thought it'd be awesome to turn the characters of the app into a pack of flashcards! Each card has a letter of the Moji Moji alphabet to help your little one learn their ABC's, and while the final design for this reward is still in progress we're confident you'll love the result. Reward Details: Alphabet Jigsaw Puzzle We're excited to bring the Moji Moji alphabet to life in the form of a fun jigsaw puzzle to engage kids off of the screen. The final design for this reward is still a in progress but we're super excited to make it happen. The puzzle will have roughly 25 pieces and be about 12"" x 17"" in size. Behind the Scenes! Every part of the Moji Moji world has been handcrafted by award-winning animators and sound designers to be memorable, unique, and of the highest artistic caliber. We traveled the world interviewing parents and found that there were no digital learning tools that were truly beautiful. We wanted to create a fun, playful way for children to be prepared for kindergarten that was thoughtfully crafted. We designed a world that brings together cutting-edge research in education, creative expression, and data-driven insights for parents. We hope Moji Moji challenges the way people think about early learning and we’re excited to share it with the world. Device Requirements Moji Moji will be available for iPad on the App Store worldwide. Minimum device requirements: iPad Mini 4, iPad Air 2, iPad 5 or later, iOS 8 or later. Anything Else I Need to Know? Nope, we think that's it. If you have any questions let us know and we'll build out the FAQ with more details.

Our place is the Check Point Bar. A central hub for all things Geek. Check Point Bar is more than the ""Sports Bar"" version for all things Geek. It’s a headquarters, it’s a home base, and it’s a crossroads where every type of Geek is welcomed. Most importantly, it will cater to your passions. As a community, we are diverse in our passions. That makes us Mighty! By working together, we will build a place where everyone is treated with respect and dignity -by the venue Staff and by their fellow Geeks. No one should have to limit when they can geek out - no more waiting once a year for a Con or every other month for an event. Check Point Bar will be waiting for you 365 days a year. Our Origin Story It was like any other Wednesday - a few of us met for happy hour drinks at a sports pub. Someone asked if one of the TV’s could be tuned to BBC or a SciFi channel. Eyes rolled. I thought, is it such a big deal to change the channel to a rerun of TNG? I asked myself, is this what it’s like for the average Geek without an event planned by some group? If a person didn’t visit one of the 2 or 3 Geek-style bars in all of New York City, where did they go? Do we all need to wait once or twice a year to year to Cosplay at a Con? Later that day, I walked into a bar for a NY SciFi & Fantasy group event. I first noticed the bartender, Kevin's, bow tie. Bow ties are COOL! He had set up a projector and was screening a really bad, but funny horror movie. He turned and asked if there was anything I wanted to watch such as TNG or Doctor Who. He apologized that he couldn't set up his 8-Bit Nintendo, as the owner wanted him to cut back on the Geek events and decor. I nearly fell out of my seat! We knew right then and there we all deserve a bar dedicated to all Geeks. We have the numbers, we have the technology. We're about customer service for the individual and the group. We're about creating a home base - a place where you can watch the shows and movies you want to see. A place that is always there waiting for you. A venue which celebrates, promotes and is centered around all forms of our culture so we can celebrate with all our Heroes and Villains. The world has caught up to us and we have grown as a community to be able to build it and sustain it. Let’s make it so… So say we all! Milton Ousland Founder & CEO","Risks & Challenges & Where will your money go? Where will your money go?  We have a good team in place and everyone has their specialty. There is also no shortage of people who are passionate and want to be involved.  The main challenge, as with any new venture, is ensuring we stay on target with our financial goals/projections and continuously add to our resources. We are building a large enough resource pool to push into the NYC market.  If you haven’t noticed, the price of square footage is dramatically increasing by the month, even in the most remote places in NYC. This campaign helps this issue on the front-end by easing initial costs, and on the back-end with the decor, e.g., Geeking out the bar. This allows us to, over the next few months, focus on building a larger resource pool made up of crowd funding, more investors, loans, grants, and sponsorships for everything in the middle.  The money for the decor will be used for themed booths: we have designs for a Trek booth, Gamers booth and for a stretch goal - a booth you can sit dressed in your Han Solo outfit and feel right at home (until you have to shoot first!). It will also be used for gamer equipment and items representing various Geek cultures to spread around the bar.  We intend to keep build-out costs low in 2 ways:  We have a ton of construction experience within the team, from property managers to foremen, so we can handle a large portion of the build. Also, by seeking out existing furniture from former/closed restaurants and bars - from stools to booths to the bar itself - we can redesign and/or modify items to save on costs. We will of course use standard industry systems for staff, inventory, and quality controls to ensure we run as efficiently as possible. After we open, instead of Geek groups spending their time, money, and resources to organize events at other locations that do not cater to Geeks, we can keep those resources in-house. This allows us all to grow together. ",failed

Cricket-232 is a tiny TTL/CMOS to RS-232 converter designed to be the perfect plug and play component for all your prototypes that require easy, low cost, point-to-point serial communication. It is the simplest way to connect anything with a UART/USART - including RaspberryPi and Arduino boards.  Cricket is designed to plug into breadboards but is also perfect as a stand-alone PCB component, saving you time without compromising on board space or signal quality. Link to Cricket-232 Page: http://proto-lux.com/cricket-232/ Download Datasheet  Features: Designed to work perfectly for breadboarding and as a PCB component. Superior signal strength RS-232 with a single IC charge pump. Transmits at 9V typical. Accepts single supply 3-5.5volts input. Can be placed over other components to save board space (1.3mm bottom clearance).   Requires no external components. Confusion free labeling. Data indication LEDs. 1 x 9.3mm Footprint. Feature Notes:       This design uses superior quality, charge pump capacitors with 22 times the capacitance of those used by competing products. This enables Cricket to efficiently deliver robust transmissions.      The data indication LEDs output ample light at very low currents. We have strived to reach the perfect balance of brightness with data performance. Too much current through the LEDs could potentially disrupt communications at high data rates. We have accomplished this by keeping the maximum instantaneous LED current less than .5mA while providing highly visible indication of even a single byte in working conditions of 7lux ambient. Pin Configuration: This is a diagram depicting the labels and pin configuration of the shipped units. Other images may show earlier configurations.  Mechanical Dimensions: All mechanical dimensions are in millimeters unless otherwise specified. Tolerances: +/-.15mm.  ","Cricket has been helping make prototyping faster and easier for over two years now. We are confident in its ability to perform reliably.   We are using newly released, high-efficiency/high-output LEDs to achieve high visibility without interfering with data reliability. Because they are new to market, very high demand may result in several weeks lead time. If purchases increase at a very high rate we shall have to gauge the trajectory of the demand and initiate component orders and manufacturing early. We have set aside adequate funding for this contingency plan.   We have secured manufacturing agreements and have been very happy with the quality standards of our current manufacture. There should be no insurmountable problems with our manufacture at this late stage in the product development. Furthermore our manufacturer performs full product testing on 100% of the requested manufactured product. ",failed

Clients are beginning to ask about the sustainability of the designs we’re creating for them. The people attending our workshops (from complete beginners to seasoned florists) want to know how to create floral designs in more sustainable ways. A Guide to Floral Mechanics is not a book on how to arrange flowers, it's a book showing how to create the mechanics behind sustainable floral designs. Information on sustainable floristry is scattered far and wide and involves a lot of trial and error. Finding useful information is hard work. Our aim is to bring together and refine this information, share the methods we have developed, and make it readily available. Why are we looking to raise so much money for this project? This book is about sustainable floral design. Whilst it would cost a fraction of the amount to have it printed abroad, we have found more sustainable ways to have it printed here. The printers we are working with are one of a handful of companies in the UK who are EMAS accredited, and have a zero-to-landfill policy. We have chosen fully FSC certified paper because we believe a book on sustainable practices should be made in a responsible way. Each design type outlined in the book has a minimum of 6 hand-drawn illustrations to ensure absolute clarity throughout. This is not necessarily the cheapest option, but we decided to use drawn images, as our impartial test audience found them the clearest and simplest to follow. Not to mention that Fees and Taxes make up a substantial chunk of the costs. A breakdown of the costs is available further down the page. How Kickstarter works... If the funding goal isn't reached, we don't get a penny, and it will take us a lot longer to get this book to print.  With your support, we can do this! This book will guide you through a wide range of topics, including what you'll need, and how-to guides on the following: Conditioning, vessels, tools, equipment, small arrangements, grids, kenzan, kokedama urns, large urns, meadowboxes, garlanding, floral garlanding, hand tied bouquets, bouquets with wire support, buttonholes and corsages, flower crowns, hoops, arches (fresh and planted), natural funeral work, wreaths (fresh, dried and planted), on-the-go kit, and more besides. A Guide to Floral Mechanics is just that; it gives clear, easy to follow instructions for each mechanic including clear pictures and thorough guidance at every step.  We have taken design cues from all walks of life - cookery books, the assembly instructions for putting together Ikea furniture, even car repair manuals. We have studied books on historical floristry from the British Library and immersed ourselves in literature both online and in person. We've been inspired by Constance Spry amongst others and spent years developing techniques and continue to seek out new and better ways of working. Who we are Sarah Diligent, owner of Floribunda Rose Floral Design & co-owner of Purgatory Floral. For Sarah, this book is first and foremost about the environment, about minimising our carbon footprint, and about the future of floristry. Sarah launched the Eco Friendly Florists and Flower Growers Collective which has become one of the largest eco friendly floristry groups on Facebook, as a way of sharing eco friendly tips and techniques. It became clear that a simple, easy to follow book outlining how to create floral mechanics was missing, and she wants to change that. William Mazuch, Industrial designer and co-owner of Purgatory Floral. For William, this is about doing floral design well. Without compromise. Sustainably.  We're counting on your support to finish this book, and do it well.  Your pledges will be used as follows if we manage to reach our goal: Proposed Project Timeline If our project goal is reached this is our proposed timeline, we'll keep you updated throughout the process so that you can see how we're getting along.  If our crowdfunding is successful, we'll be working with companies whose ethics align with ours.  The papers we have selected are fully FSC accredited, the printers we have standing by are based in the UK and are one of only twelve EMAS accredited printing companies in the country, with a zero to landfill waste policy. We're working with Cornwall based illustrator Sophia O'Connor who specialises in pen and ink drawings. The Bag! If you decide to back us in a tier which includes the bag, here's a mock-up of the design on one of the bags we'd be using. They're high quality, made with socially and environmentally conscious, organic, seed-to-shop cotton. The people who make them only use environmentally safe dyes and printing processes, and throughout this process they re-use materials as much as possible. Thank you for pledging! One last favour...

My name is Lizzy and I run Luna's Observatory. I am a twenty-five year old graphic designer from California. I am a huge nerd and comic book junkie who loves collecting pop figures, to crazy colored socks. I am obsessed with space and any type of music with feelings.   Iv'e been developing these pins for quite sometime and I feel like I have finally made something I think you all will enjoy! This project is to FULLY FUND all three pins and their variants!

So as of right now, no stretch goals planned. That can always change, I do have a few things lined up that I'd like to add (:     Funds Breakdown:   75% Production Cost 15% Shipping/Packaging 1% Kickstarter Fees","There is always a risk of delay's with manufacturers. Such as many second pins, wrong design, color mistakes, etc. But, I've worked with my manufacturer and they have reassured me everything will be okay! There is a possibility the pin will look different then from pictures due to monitor colors, or how things look on your screen! But not to worry, I will try my absolute hardest to keep them as close to the original design as possible. PLEASE double check shipping addresses and make sure you have the correct one so there will be no delays! ",failed

Comic Artists is a collaborative of comic book creators in the city of Chicago. Over the past three years we have created and printed four different comics anthologies (You may have backed our first or second book on Kickstarter previously). We just put the finishing touches on our fifth anthology titled ""Memories"" and rather than do a separate small print run we thought ""What the heck!"" and decided to print all five of the books in one deluxe volume. Now we just need your help funding it!  We are kickstarting a 2+ page volume containing 68 stories centered around 5 separate themes and representing the work of 44 different creators.  This book would contain five separate themed comic anthologies: Identity (1st printing, Oct 215) The Middle of the Night (1st printing, June 216) The Other Side (1st printing, February 217) Misadventure (1st printing, November 217)  Memories (Never before printed!) In addition to stories based around these themes, the interior is packed with alternate covers and behind-the-scenes content. The exterior will be wrapped in a full-color cover by Stuart Marsh. The final book will measure roughly 6x9 inches and will look great on your shelf next to other trades in your collection. Please read on to see sample art and all of the awesome rewards we are offering. What follows is a very small taste of all the awesome comics included in this book.    Memories Memories is our newest anthology and has not ever been printed before in any form! All the stories in this anthology deal with that fickle and faulty faculty that we all grapple with.  Misadventure Misadventure was our fourth anthology, printed in the fall of 217. All the stories in this volume deal with the trials and tribulations of poor souls ranging from samurai to teenagers to snipers. The Other Side The Other Side was our third anthology. It is a collection of stories about that mysterious place we always ponder. The place we can't quite see, but we can sense is there. Love, Sadness, and yes, chickens, abound. The Middle of the Night The Middle of the Night was our second anthology. It is a collection of diverse stories about alien abductions, scary stories, boogie men, and at least one owl. Identity Identity was our very first volume. It is a collection of stories ranging from poignant drama to surreal sci-fi and characters including humans, half-humans, lizard men, carrot people, and a ghost.

The devices are outfitted with electronics that allow them to synchronize with others, so that all nearby devices automatically and mutually engage in an observable process of synchronization. These devices, in isolation, appear similar to conventional LED cycling safety lights, but in groups, they exhibit an immediately noticeable and striking phenomenon. Participating cyclists are encouraged to gather for an 11:59 PM ride across the Stone Arch Bridge on June 9, the night of the festival. Northern Spark has contributed generously to this project, but more money is still needed for graphic design, raw materials, laser cutting, volunteer rewards, shipping costs, and other expenses. The aim of the project is to activate and transform the social networks and urban dynamics associated with cycling by fusing this system with one biased towards synchronization -- an outward display of unity through cooperative display, perception and adjustment. Grafting this artificial dynamic system of synchronized blinking lights (a textbook example from the domain of cybernetics) onto a real-world urban transportation system will accomplish two goals: 1. call attention to the individual act of cycling as a component of a larger dynamic system with its own unique patterns and qualities, and 2. momentarily transform that system through a subtle but pointed intervention in urban social space. All steps of the project are documented and published on a project blog: http://1fireflies.net. The software and hardware implementation details are published under an open-source license, allowing others to reproduce and tinker with the design. All files are available on GitHub. Update -- Thanks to everyone who has supported this project! We've reached the goal of $1,, but our true goal is 1, cyclists. If you haven't yet, reserve your light today and join us on June 9 at Northern Spark.",,success

On Behalf of The People was originally commissioned by The National Coal Mining Museum for England (NCMME). Following a successful premiere and small scale tour in 217, we are seeking support to tour this exciting new play in the Spring/Summer, 218. The Play On Behalf of The People by Ray Castleton, is a two-act play originally commissioned by NCMME as part of their 217 programme of events to mark the 7th anniversary of the 1947 nationalisation of the British coal mining industry. Since the demise and dismantling of the coal industry in the 198’s many stories, plays and films have been written and produced about the industry and the communities which depended on it and how they have fared since; important stories which need to be told about a period which deserves ongoing debate. But this play differs from those stories in that, whilst it also connects the audience to a period of seismic social change and struggle, it is set in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War and takes the audience on the journey of hope and determination of a mining family through to the Coronation celebrations of 1953. It is a story of political and social change which we believe is not told often enough. On Behalf of The People distils the time and the social changes into a heartfelt and endearing story of a family coming to terms with the loss of one son whilst embracing the return of another. It shows the family coping with all their private emotions about work, politics, health, love and relationships. The play takes powerful turns of joy, heartache, aspiration and struggle layered with deep emotions of love, loss and loyalty to one’s family and colleagues. The story is delivered by four characters and is laced with dry wit, humour and a sense of realism.   On Behalf of The People - development The play was an original commission by the National Coal Mining Museum, Wakefield and premiered in July 217 as part of the museum’s exhibition ‘By The People for The People’, marking the 7 years since coal nationalisation. There followed a short community venue tour across the Yorkshire region. Audiences, critics (4* ReviewsHub) and theatre programmers loved the play and as a result we now have planned a 32-performance tour in May-July 218. Audience Response  Watch our ‘voxpop’ video of audience reaction to the premiere Audience Survey We have received 94.6% 5* and 5.4% 4* ratings. Below is a sample of survey comments: ""[I enjoyed] the reality of the dialogue, the plot and the quality of the acting."" ""[I enjoyed] the story line about the problems and the hopes for the future. Acting excellent also. "" ""How fantastic it was! The acting was superb, the subject matter local and about the working man, a topic close to my own heart. "" ""This was a truly brilliant play. I was captivated from the first moment. Well written, well directed and well-acted play. ""  ""Please make sure you take this to other venues. It's important as many people see this performance as possible. I loved it. "" ""It was an excellent experience. The simplicity of the set kept the focus on the characters and the story. It's great to keep our history alive by performing the stories and emotions of the time. I liked the intimate atmosphere, the closeness to the actors, you felt involved"". ""The story as it was very true to life. The acting was equally as good. More plays like this one please!!   ""I learned a lot but never felt like I was being lectured. The factual information was generated naturally from the characters and situation. "" ""An excellent balance of humour and poignancy "" 218 Tour The 218 tour schedule is currently being finalised, but will begin at the end of May 218 and extend to 2 July 218. Confirmed venues include:  Crucible Theatre Studio, Sheffield; Theatre Royal, Wakefield; York Theatre Royal; Square Chapel, Halifax; CAST Theatre, Doncaster; Pocklington Arts Centre; The Civic, Barnsley; Wortley Hall, Sheffield; Greater Manchester Fringe Festival; Chesterfield College; Elsecar Heritage Centre, Barnsley; Grove Hall, South Kirkby; Buxton Fringe Festival; Greater Manchester Fringe Festival; The Venue, Stocksbridge, Sheffield; Firbeck Village Hall, Rotherham; Wirksworth Town Hall, Derbyshire; The Imperial Rooms, Matlock; St Johns Church Hall, Staincross; Otley Court House, Yorkshire Hathersage Memorial Hall, Derbyshire  ","The Melting Shop theatre company is seeking Kickstarter funding as part of an overall project budget of c.£38K. We are seeking the support from audiences, theatre lovers and those who wish to support the arts especially new writing and theatre-making in the Yorkshire region.  The 2018 tour is currently awaiting a decision on an Arts Council funding bid. The Kickstarter fundraising campaign alongside other sponsorship fundraising activity would account for less than 3% of the total project budget. The money raised will specifically go towards PR and marketing activity to help promote and sell the show to as wide an audience as possible - particularly harder to reach groups and non-theatre goers. Budgeted ticket sales will account for over 29% and the Arts Council funding is just under 68% of the total budget. Every penny of cost in the budget is assigned to ensuring the show is produced and tours and that all actors, stage manager and producers are paid properly in accordance with Equity guidelines. The result of our Arts Council funding bid will be known by the beginning of February 2018. ",failed

We are using this campaign to build larger quantities, to bring the costs down and to set up a full time assembly line. We want to pass those savings on to our previous DLS customers as well. If this campaign is successful and you purchased a DLS for full price between May 15th and the launch of this campaign we will send you refund for the difference.  That's right, we will retroactively refund you.  Thank you for supporting us!  The DLS - 5w / 7w Desktop Laser System  The DLS is already shipping to real customers.  This is not vaporware or a beta product.  We need your help to begin mass production by setting up a dedicated assembly line. The DLS is the ultimate value in desktop style lasers. Its rugged, all metal, fireproof exterior and quality components are designed for years of trouble free use while producing industry leading quality output.  We have been working really hard on this the past couple of years to bring this to fruition.  Each system has been tested by real people in the real world under full production loads and we are proud to say our work has paid off!  The final assembly, calibration, quality control and support are all done in the USA. The DLS can cut simple or complex projects in organic materials like wood, leather and shell as well as plastics like acrylic and Delrin. The edges of materials like acrylic come out of the laser fully polished.   Stack Laser Cut Plywood for 3D Projects. The Ebony Veneer Was Cut by Laser too for a Perfect Fit! The DLS can engrave virtually everything including woods, plastics, glass, stone and marking on all metals with coatings like anodized aluminum or directly on steels. Rasters, vectors and even photos can be engraved to 232 DPI! Engrave Wood, Glass, Metal, Stone and More!     Software You Already Know The DLS will import rasters, vectors and photos from the software you already use.  From there its simply a matter of scale, rotation and specifying cutting power and speed before starting a cutting or engraving job.

Shipping via Freight The DLS is heavy.  It comes fully assembled in a wooden crate with the accessories (chiller, exhaust etc.) in separate cardboard boxes.  The total weight of the delivery is 35 pounds which REQUIRES freight shipment, this cannot be shipped via regular UPS or Fedex due to the size and weight. We will arrange all freight deliveries for you, don't worry!  ","The DLS is already in production just not at the scale we would like it to be. It has already been delivered all over the world so we understand the logistics required. We want you to help us get to the next level and set up an assembly line specifically for these machines rather than building them one at a time like we do now. We want to decrease our lead time and have them available in stock with no lead time by Q3 2017. There are no engineering challenges to overcome because the DLS is already shipping, nor any unknowns with regards to suppliers or assembly; we just want to make it more efficient and faster. We will be hiring some new talent and building this new assembly line in order to accomplish these goals. All of the risky stuff has already been sorted, we just need to speed up and you can help us get there! Setting up a new assembly line and training new hires may take more time than we expect, however, we already have production in place and will be sending out units one by one until the new line is running efficiently.

Here is how you might know me... I love computer animation.  I love learning about it and I love teaching it. I decided a very long time ago that I would really like to make an animated feature with graduates of the school I founded. We have a great story to tell and with your help, we are going to do something that nobody has ever done before! When alien thugs attack a deep space station, NAVY SEALS and NASA ASTRONAUTS are teamed together to rescue the survivors. While still being an outrageous action adventure, our story celebrates the courage and heroism of our greatest explorers and our bravest soldiers in a way that children and their parents can experience together. What started as a class project is now ready to become a feature length film. Animated features can cost tens of millions of dollars to produce. Without the resources to complete a finished work, filmmakers often choose to create shorts. We’ve done that. Twice! Once as a live action short (24), and later as an animated short (28). After years of development, several collaborators, mentors, and countless drafts we have a script! A really great one. This means we intend to tell the entire 94 page screenplay in a highly creative yet minimally technical way. Every element (character, set, prop, vehicle, or creature) will be constructed as a ""simple but cool"" approximation of what would be needed for a finished film. An element that might take a studio like DreamWorks or Pixar 3 people and a month to prepare, we will do in a day. Will it look as good? No way! but it will pull you into the story and it will take you on our amazing adventure! Telling stories like this with the amazing possibilities that computer animation provides shouldn't be limited to a handful of corporately owned studios. We may not open on 3, theater screens, but with all the new ways people are enjoying content, NASA SEALS stands an excellent chance of finding an audience and a place in our popular culture. Once that happens we can develop a reasonable business model that will allow us continue. In the past few years low cost live action filmmaking tools have given voice to hundreds of directors who may have otherwise been overlooked. This is happening with animation as well. While we won’t be pushing the bleeding edge of computer imagery, you will follow the adventure of a 17 year old boy who is going to try to save the earth to impress a girl... and you’re going to cry! It's important to note that while the school played an important role in the origin of this project, it’s not producing this film. Even with a successful campaign we could not begin to quit our day jobs, build a studio, buy new equipment, or hire a full time staff. This money will be used to pay recent animation school graduates to perform small but pivotal tasks on the film. When we need a spaceship designed we will have something to pay the artist. Then that design will go to a modeler who will likely build it on their workstation at home. Most will only work on the film a few hours a week, but they still need to get paid. Below is the original NASA SEALS Live action short made in 24! In 28 we made this animated short. Minimate fans may remember our film Batman New Times starring Adam West, Mark Hamil, and Dick Van Dyke.  ...as well as our rap video Minimate Galactica! This won the SyFy Channel's fan film contest!","There is always the risk that we will run out of money before the film is done or we are unable to fulfill our rewards. The people involved are committed to the project and will do everything in our power to complete this project and fulfill our rewards. We have been working on this for 10 years now and to say we are driven to make this happen is a ridiculous understatement. Even if we are ultimately unable to finish the film, you can count on sharing the journey every step of the way through updates, production blogs, and videos. But to be clear, we do plan to finish the movie! None of these rewards are too complicated or expensive to deliver; they will be our first priority of upon funding. Scenes that include a backer's name, likeness or performance will be the first to be produced and will be shared with you immediately. ",failed

really measures good health? Weight, steps-taken, calories burned, sleep, heart rate? These are all important indicators but research shows that body composition, or a healthy balance of body fat, is the ultimate sign of good health and physical fitness.     RIDM is the first portable device with body composition analysis (BCA) accuracy equivalent to professional-grade bio-electrical impedance analysis (BIA) machines. PLAY  Until now, body composition analysis for personal use has never been accurate. Existing products relied on basic chipsets only capable of measuring on one frequency and only measuring one part of the body. From that incomplete scan, they guessed total body composition.   RIDM IS A BREAKTHROUGH! RIDM's chipset is capable of measuring across five frequencies, while also measuring the entire body across five cross-sections. Applying the same breakthrough technologies that made InBody the leader in body composition analysis to a palm-sized device. RIDM is capable of achieving the same measurement accuracy as $2, professional-grade InBody machines.   RIDM is currently preparing for FDA registration & undergoing clinical tests in the U.S. & Korea. Viral Thread - ""This tiny device helps you achieve your fitness goals..""

Every year on January 1st, Google searches related to fitness make a dramatic spike in popularity. But in just 6 weeks, that desire to get healthy fades to the norm. We’ve all been there. It’s all too easy to get frustrated and simply give up when results stop showing. Getting fit is a lifestyle, not a 6-week program. Let RIDM keep you motivated by showing results even when they don’t show up on a mirror or on a scale. For health, what is important is not body weight, but body composition. At the same weight, someone with high body fat and low muscle mass will be vulnerable to health risks, decreased immunity and more rapid aging. Body composition also is reflected in body shape or visual appearance. Even if you are at a healthy weight, a beer belly means an excess of visceral fat, which can increase risk of cardiovascular disease and type-2 diabetes. In your 3s, muscle mass naturally begins to decrease. Starting at 4, if you’re physically inactive, total muscle mass can decrease up to 1% every year. Healthy development of muscle mass alone, can improve overall fitness and lower risk of high blood pressure, high cholesterol and hip disease. Analyze your body composition and see the results in an intuitive one-screen health report. RIDM analyzes the body even beyond basic statistics such as weight, body fat, & skeletal muscle.   Accounting for segmental lean, RIDM can pin-point imbalances in the body while also accounting for total water weight, skeletal muscle mass, basal metabolic rate. A written report, briefly summarizes your body type and what lifestyle changes can benefit your overall health. Monitor changes and set goals through the RIDM app. With RIDM, health data is broken down by category into easy to follow charts and graphs. By tracking changes to your body, learn what diet and exercises are most effective, specific to your body composition. One-screen visuals track weight, muscle mass and body fat percentage separately. RIDM can track indefinitely and is only limited by your phone’s storage capacity. Want to track activity? Simply sync to your Google Health, iHealth app or FitBit and activity logs will be displayed directly on the RIDM companion app Commercial BIA machines have been around since the mid-198s. In the 199s technological advancements in BIA, notably direct measurement of body segments and multi-frequency measurement, validated the accuracy of BIA to the clinical research community. However, while these two core technologies have been integrated into BCA scales, the limitations of mobile chipsets made these capabilities impossible in portable devices. High-end BCA machines are priced at $5 ~ $2, and gyms will often charge $15-$4 per-use. More consumer-friendly devices have since appeared in the form of smart scales or bands, but what they make up for in price, they sacrifice in accuracy. RIDM provides accuracy equivalent to professional-grade BCA machines for under the cost of two BCA readings. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), analyzes your body composition on the cellular level. By sending a small alternating current through the body and tracking electrical resistance, BIA is capable of measuring total body water, as resistance fluctuates based on the amount of water in the body. From this measurement, fat-free body mass, body weight and body fat can be derived. Your body contains an incredibly large number of cells, made up of both intracellular and extracellular fluid. Lower frequency currents can only measure extracellular water. Meanwhile, higher frequency currents are needed to pass through cell walls measuring intracellular water mass.   As a measure of total body water, fluid build-up or edema, used to cause large inaccuracy in BIA analysis. However, multi-frequency measurement highly improves accuracy with the ability to gauge both extracellular and intracellular water mass. Whereas traditional BCA machines used a single frequency at 5kHz, RIDM operates across a range of five frequencies, alleviating discrepancies due to hydration levels. The majority of BCA devices project fat percentage based on a singular scan of the upper or lower body. The results of these incomplete readings are then inputted into a set algorithm to estimate body composition as a whole.   The problem? These partial readings cannot account for individualized imbalances in the body. Nobody is 1% evenly distributed and imbalances occur between the right/left side and upper/lower body. RIDM’s unique segmental-lean measurement accounts for imbalances in the body by measuring across five body cross-sections For monitoring changes to body composition, we recommend one session per day. Unlike fitness trackers or wearables, RIDM doesn’t need to be worn 24/7. Each session only requires a minute or so, so you can spend less time checking and more time doing. For best accuracy, try to be consistent with both time of measurement and measurement posture. Compact and portable, RIDM allows you to check body composition just about anywhere. Measuring in at 2.28 (diameter) x .51 (width) inches and weighing in at an ultralight 32 grams, there’s always ample room in your purse, tote or backpack to carry RIDM. With your smartphone, laptop, smartwatch, you already have enough devices to remember to charge. After one full charge, RIDM can provide enough measurements for nearly half a year. A micro USB cable will be included with RIDM for charging. Easy-mode offers a one-step scan. Simply hold the first pose for 7 seconds. Measure in easy-mode for your daily quick scan.   Segmental-mode measures your body composition across five body cross-sections. In segmental-mode hold each pose for 7 seconds. The process can be completed in under one minute. Measure in segmental mode every week or so for a more in-depth analysis. It’s YOUR fitness journey, so we definitely understand the need for privacy. Health data is never saved or sent to any remote server. With no printed reports, your data is only accessible by you through RIDM’s companion app. If you change phones, you can still retrieve your past health logs by utilizing data back-up on your RIDM app.   RIDM is already far along in development, with sensor testing and prototype assembly already complete. Previously, BCA devices were only available in the form of scales or bands. RIDM completely re-thinks what a BCA device can look like and how it can be experienced. Accurate health data in a device small enough to fit in your pocket.  PLAY  RIDM’s case adds a playful accent to a minimalist and un-intrusive design. With an intuitive hook design, RIDM can be hung from any number of surfaces. Made of soft and pliable rubber, the hook case provides simple storage and a comfortable grip during measurement. Upon a quick scan of Amazon comments for portable BCA devices, one of the most common complaints is frustration with WiFi or Bluetooth pairing. RIDM syncs effortlessly and instantaneously to both iPhone and Android smart phones through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). RIDM will offer a 6-month limited warranty for all faulty products. Once the claim is processed, a replacement RIDM will be delivered free of charge. For more information, please e-mail: ridm.crowdfunding@gmail.com  RIDM does not claim to offer any medical advice, diagnosis or treatment and under no circumstances should it be substituted for it. Please only use RIDM for routine checks to monitor dieting and exercise progress. If you have any health problems, please consult with your doctor or medical professional. Please do not use RIDM if you are pregnant, currently under treatment by any electronic medical device, require assistance from any electronic support system, or have undergone operation for any metallic aids or implants. Particular care should be taken if you require the assistance of a pacemaker or defibrillator, or if you have undergone procedure for an artificial heart or lung. For people under the age of 18 or over the age of 7, RIDM may not provide accurate readings of body composition. All funds raised on Kickstarter will go towards the research, testing and development of RIDM and the companion application. Your generous support will speed the development of this next breakthrough in BIA technology, enabling it to guide physical fitness and wellness the world over. Note to Backers: Duty & customs fees may be applied in addition to shipping costs. Please note that we cannot individually address each and every one of these claims and therefore backers are responsible for taking the appropriate measures to clear customs.","A working prototype of RIDM has already completed development. As the most accurate portable BCA device available, the challenge moving forward will be to continuously upgrade accuracy and consistency of measurement Through data acquired through repeated clinical trials, RIDM’s internal algorithm will be updated regularly to combat inconsistencies. RIDM’s firmware will be upgraded through app update. In Korea, the first phase of clinical trials has concluded and a second round of testing is currently scheduled. Plans for testing at a U.S. hospital are also under development. ",failed

pictured in Walnut finish. Meet SpeakEasy™ by Como Audio, with the Google Assistant built-in.  Designed for those who want to enjoy the highest quality sound of music, the ability to control compatible devices throughout the home, and manage every day tasks – all with the power of your voice with hands-free help from your Assistant.   SpeakEasy | Sets Itself Apart   SpeakEasy™ stands out from the competition in several important ways: Sound Quality | Designed to Play Music Furniture Grade Wood Cabinetry  Multi-room Control | Google Chromecast SpeakEasy™ Portability with Optional Battery Pack Visual Display | Clock and Alarm | Self Adjusting Brightness Manual Control Knobs SpeakEasy™ with the Google Assistant built in allows you to speak voice commands to play music “OK Google....play my favorite country song,” get information “What's the weather today?,” or control your home environment “Turn up the thermostat 5 degrees,” or “Dim the lights.” Set up is done through the free Google Home app for iOS and Android with compatible devices. Founding CEO Tom DeVesto started Como Audio with the single goal of creating beautiful music systems that allow simple and easy access to the myriad of music content available to today’s music enthusiast. SpeakEasy™ takes this simplicity to the next level with the Google Assistant built-in. Tom DeVesto reviewing designs at Como Audio in Boston, MA Sound Quality | Designed to Play Music A ¾” soft dome tweeter, 3” custom, dual voice coil woofer, and custom DSP equalization result in great high-fidelity sound, reproducing your favorite music as it should be heard. The rear port further enhances low bass frequencies while conveniently doubling as a carry handle.  A 25 watt per channel Class D digital amplifier supplies plenty of volume, while a nearly ½” thick MDF cabinet holds everything together.  Supported audio codecs: HE-AAC, LC-AAC, CELT/Opus, MP3, Vorbis, Wav, and FLAC. Furniture Grade Wood Cabinetry SpeakEasy™ is made with a robust cabinet wrapped in a real walnut or hickory wood veneer or high gloss, multi-layered piano black or white finish. The top and front panels and knobs are anodized aluminum and the speaker grilles are painted aluminum. Outside of the LED display and sensor, no plastic is used on the baffle. Multi-room Control | Google Chromecast SpeakEasy™ has the ability to wirelessly link with other Como Audio Music Systems to create whole house multi-room streaming. This is great news for our existing Como Audio customers.  Simply connect Google Chromecast Audio Devices (not included) to other units and ask SpeakyEasy™ with the Google Assistant to play your favorite music in one room or all rooms in your home.  Google Chromecast Audio Device (not included) shown without power supply. Adhered to unit with velcro. SpeakEasy Portable  Another important distinction is the ability to use an optional 22mAh battery pack to make SpeakEasy™ portable. Experience an average of 8 hours playback time on a full charge, enough for most situations. A battery icon on the display illuminates to let you know when the battery is charging. A 1-24V / 5-6Hz external adapter is included. When turned off in battery-only mode (or if the battery runs out of power), SpeakEasy™ is completely off (not in standby) and can only be turned on by pressing the Power knob. In this state the display will be off, the alarm cannot activate, and the Google Home app will not work. As with our Amico model, this is deliberate in order to conserve battery power since the display and WiFi require a good deal of power. If the clock or alarm is required then the included adapter should remain connected. Visual Display |  Clock & Alarm  A crisp LED display continually shows the time without you having to ask. Display icons indicate when the Alarm is set, when the Alarm is in Snooze mode, and when the Sleep timer is active. A front panel photocell sensor automatically adjusts the red backlight based on ambient light conditions. SpeakEasy™ pictured in walnut with the Hotword button on top. Actual finished product may vary. Manual Control Knobs   We’ve also included something you don’t see much anymore- actual front panel knobs when you prefer to do things the old-fashioned way and manually control Volume (and On/Off in battery mode), Play/Pause, Microphone mute, and Bluetooth. SpeakEasy Stereo speaker   Create a high-fidelity stereo system when SpeakEasy™ is connected to the optional, wired, dedicated right channel speaker for authentic, two-channel stereo for greater imaging and a broader soundstage. *This is a handmade prototype. Actual finished product may vary. Bluetooth 4.2 Should your WiFi network become temporarily unavailable, or if you wish to access a source not available through WiFi, Bluetooth is on-board to provide a CD-quality, wireless, stereo streaming alternative. SpeakEasy pictured in Piano White  Automatic Software Updates Get free automatic software updates via WiFi from Google and Como Audio whenever features are added or improved so your SpeakEasy™ is always up to date. Google Home App Setting up your SpeakEasy™ and linking your premium music streaming accounts, Chromecast Audio Devices, and compatible home devices is made simple using the free Google Home app for iSO, Android, MAC, Windows, and Chromebook. Smart Phone Charging You’ll get a charge out of this: A rear panel 5V/1A USB output will charge your smart device when it’s running low on juice (when power supply is connected to SpeakEasy™). SpeakEasy pictured in Piano Black SpeakEasy Setup PLAY  Third Kickstarter Campaign Our first two Kickstarter campaigns (Solo/Duetto and Amico/Musica) raised over a half million dollars combined and allowed us to bring to market some truly special audio products that have enjoyed consistently favorable reviews from customers and leading audio critics. This wouldn’t have been possible without the Kickstarter community. We think this, our third campaign, will be our best yet and we’re very excited to once again work with backers to help make SpeakEasy™ a reality. Timeline    About Over the last 4 years, consumer electronics Hall of Fame Legend and Visionary Tom DeVesto focused on consistently bringing new experiences to the consumer electronics market, enhancing and improving upon expectations. Whether he was introducing the theater experience to the home audiences at Advent and with Kloss Video big screen TVs in the 197’s, or selling stereo systems direct to the consumer at Cambridge SoundWorks in the 198’s and 9’s, or making high performance radios with great design and sound reflective of another era at Tivoli Audio, Tom DeVesto never lost sight of the his goal: make a high quality product that supports the latest technology — is simple to operate – has distinctive design – takes up a small amount of space – and doesn’t become obsolete. Millions of the products created by Tom DeVesto are used around the world today. He returns to the consumer electronics marketplace with a new Boston, Massachusetts based company “Como Audio”. Here he will continue his goal of bringing high performance, vision, design and long lasting products to the consumer. Products that will, hopefully, continue to raise the bar on their expectations.

A long time ago, two races ruled peacefully over the Earth: HUMANS and MONSTERS.  One day, a terrible war broke out between the two races.  After a long battle, the humans were victorious. They sealed the monsters underground with a magical spell. In the year 21X, a small child scales Mt. Ebott. It is said that those who climb the mountain never return.    Seeking refuge from the rainy weather, the child enters a cave and discovers an enormous hole.    Moving closer to get a better look... the child falls in.    Now, our story begins.     UNDERTALE is a Role-playing Game for Windows.   Although UNDERTALE is an original game, the demo has already received many favorable comparisons to the MOTHER (Earthbound) series, specifically MOTHER 3. Other have compared it to Cave Story, the Shin Megami Tensei series, Touhou, and Homestuck. Existing features:    - Fighting is wholly unnecessary: negotiate your way out of danger using the unique battle system.   - Time your attacks for extra damage, then dodge enemy attacks in a style reminiscent of top-down shooters.  - Use the format of a video game to tell the story: traditional fourth-wall breaking tropes such as ""SAVING,"" ""EXP,"" and ""LV"" are an intergrated part of the game's world. - Obligatory puzzles. Lots and lots of obligatory puzzles.  - Original art and soundtrack brimming with personality. - Captivating story with an emphasis on humor.   Planned features:    - Become friends with all of the bosses! - Hilariously bad dating sim segments! - Seriously, you can literally have a robot husband. Team Members Toby Fox is the creator, lead composer, writer, main programmer, community manager, and enemy artist of the game. His musical compositions are often featured in the mixed media webcomic, Homestuck. He has a degree in Ruins Biology from Toriel Tech. Tuyoki is the main artistic assistant for Undertale. She drew the prologue artwork, the inside of Toriel's house, most of the overworld sprites, and the concept art in the manual. She loves pomeranians.  Other artists are also lending a hand. easynam and merrigo have already contributed overworld art to the demo! Guzusuru drew the kickstarter thumbnail and will be assisting with animations in the full game.   Froggit doesn't know why he's here. KICKSTARTER REWARD TIERS WHERE WILL THE MONEY GO?:   - First, I will absorb the money into my bloodstream and use it to fuel the creation of this game. With your contributions I will be able to support myself and focus on the game.   - More money will be used to ensure all artists contributing to the game are fairly compensated.   - A chunk of money will go to taxes, item production costs, and processing fees.  - Any money left over after the game's development will go towards extending the world of UnderTale outside of the game... maybe through another game!

With your funding, I estimate a full release of UNDERTALE by Summer 214. This project means a lot to me - I'd really appreciate the opportunity to bring my characters to life! Let's make a game about LOVE.","Most of the technical challenges I was worried about have been resolved during my work on the demo.  My most significant challenge will be balancing my work on the game with my professional work. I am returning to school in the Fall for the final few semesters of my undergraduate degree. There is also some work I must still complete for Homestuck. I wouldn't be surprised if I end up working on the game to the exclusion of these other two things. But for now I am factoring my work on them into the predicted release date.  The only risk is that I will not finish the game on time. However, the majority of the systems are already in place, and I have all of the major points of the game planned out. ",success

Commissioning Initiative  Commissioning a Companion Piece to Copland’s Appalachian Spring A few years ago, the Board of Directors met at an annual meeting.  On the agenda was the future of Hop River Chamber Music (HRCM). Among the ideas brainstormed was the thought to a commission a piece to be premiered by the Hop River musicians.  The directors became very excited at this idea and a small committee was formed to explore the idea. There was a wide variety of options on the table; a call for scores, a competition, getting a student from one of the local universities to compose for free, and others among them. You can see how the budgetary bottom line seemed to be driving the discussion, rather than the quality of the piece being commissioned. Soon we realized that if we were going through all this trouble, why not make a significant difference to the chamber music scene.  When highly qualified composers can get $1 or more per minute of music they write, we knew this was a HUGE step for us to take. As chairperson of the committee, I wished to utilize the considerable strengths of HRCM and the vast local talent.  Using as many of our regular players as possible was a major concern, and when one director suggested a chamber orchestra piece like ""Appalachian Spring,"" we finally seemed to have a focus for our efforts.  A comprehensive list of distinguished local composers was compiled and the directors listened to samples of their music.  A short list of two remained. It wasn't until the inspiration for a ballet scenario came to me that this seemed to be a real opportunity to create something of lasting value.  The idea was broached to the two candidates, and both immediately felt a connection to the idea.  Choosing one over the other was very difficult.  I could see the passion and skill set each could bring to the project and HRCM would be very well served by either of them. Ultimately, the commission was offered to Kenneth Fuchs and the rest of this history remains to be seen. The Composition's Requirements The piece is conceived as a stand-alone work, although its inherent dramatic/choreographic possibilities will be apparent and highlighted. Hop River Chamber Music expects to premiere the work in concert in July 218 and then collaborate with a local dance company to present it as a dramatic work within a year afterward.      The intent is to create a work of linked episodes, although a suite of 4 or more “scenes” might better represent the concept. The full instrumentation is: Flute Clarinet Bassoon Piano 4 Violins 2 Violas 2 Violincellos  1 Double Bass A portion of the work will be suitable for performance when excerpted from the whole work, scored for a subset of the full instrumentation. eg. String quartet, piano trio, etc.       The best working title for the piece is Fall in New England, although any descriptive title such as Berkshire Salute, A Nutmeg Portrait, etc. may ultimately be used.  Scenario - Movement Descriptions School – The excitement of a new school year is in the air. Outside the school, students frolic. Adults huddle, gossip, and interact with their children. A lead couple test the boundaries between teasing friendship and serious infatuation. The school master calls the students to class with a variety of reactions from them. As always, one makes it to class just in the nick of time.  Apple Picking/Harvest Fair – The scene changes and the area’s agrarian roots are celebrated. The process of turning freshly picked apples into a prize winning apple pie at the Harvest Fair is shown. Apple pickers dance. Lead boy presents the apples he has picked to lead girl. The lead girl, hoping to impress him, joins the rival bakers as they produce their best efforts and parade to the Harvest Fair for judging. A winner is selected and celebrated. The losers, lead girl among them, vow to win next year. Although the contest is lost, the boy is won.  Funeral – The weather turns cold and solemn. A family mourns the passing of a cherished member. They dance their “eulogies” individually and collectively. The lead boy sincerely, but perhaps a bit awkwardly, offers his condolences to the lead girl and her family. A subtle change in the family’s mood can be seen before they drift off to their daily chores.  Family Gatherings – The warmth of family life takes the chill off the preceding scene. We see visiting family members being reunited with loved ones. After a moment of grateful reflection together, the opening scene is recalled as cousins frolic, adults reminisce, gossip, and interact with their children. The lead boy and girl commit to each other and announce their engagement to the acclamation and frenzied excitement of all.  You made it this far. Thank you.  Now, reward yourself with a Strauss waltz played by musicians of Hop River Chamber Music. https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5176443/Strauss%2C%2Johann%2Jr.%2Rosen%2aus%2dem%2Suden%2C%2Op.%2388.mp3","We are exceedingly grateful that Ken Fuchs has taken an interest in this project.

Please check our ''rewards'' section for more info. bitter pill. noun. a distressing experience or result that is hard to accept but often necessary (often in the expression a bitter pill to swallow): Being passed over for promotion was a bitter pill to swallow.  Bitter Pill is a band of 21st vaudevillians comprised of musicians, singers, circusers, artists, actors, and awkwards. The primary focus is original live performances, but we also present classic and contemporary works re-imagined with our own twist. We mostly present theatre and music but we have been known to try just about anything.  We sing you songs, pretend you plays Show you shows that will amaze We’ve the cure for what makes you ill So open wide for a Bitter Pill  “Exhilarated. Stimulated. I've never seen anything like it."" Sean Hurly NPR ""Holy shit!"" Audience Member","The Players' Ring Theatre is a small venue, only 70 seats, and we split the gate with them. 65% for us, 35% for The Ring. That will most likely cover expenses but leave nothing left for the actors, musicians, or crew (20 people in all!) The little we raise here will help put a few dollars in each of our pockets when all is said and done. If we don't meet our goal we will have to pay for everything out of pocket and Bitter Pill will end up deep in the red.   Here is a simple breakdown of expenses....  Printing (scripts, music, etc.) $300 Costumes $500.00  Props $200.00  Special Effects $500.00  Lights $200.00  Set $400.00  Making the record $2000 (that is just to have the vinyl pressed) Kickstarter takes up to 10% of money raised  With your support you will not only help bring a rarely produced four hundred and twenty year old play to the stage, but also to bring Bitter Pill's debut record, ""Prepare Your Throats"" into the world!  The real risk is people fainting from the gore and horror. We plan on having emergency services available for the sensitive pearl-clutchers.  Here is the carnage...  ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿21 of Titus’s sons are killed in a battle before the play starts  1 human sacrifice  4 Titus’s children die during the play  4 Goths killed  6 Romans killed  10 named characters die  1 character buried alive  7 limps lopped off  2 characters baked into a pie  …and 1 act of cannibalism ",failed

Several of these songs you may have heard if you have come to any of our live shows, and some of these songs you haven’t ever heard because we are still writing more all the time! After releasing our first EP “First Transmissions” back in July, we received so much positive feedback that it inspired us to pursue our dream of making our first full-length album.  Also we believe in this music and message so much that we don’t just want to sit back and wait to see if it reaches anybody, we want to be there when it happens. That means we want to get on the road and come play for you! This is an endeavor that means so much to us. To think that our music could potentially reach outside our city and state and possibly around the world to touch someone who needs to hear this message of hope! Wow. That would be awesome One thing we have learned in our musical journey as a band is that nothing is free or easy, and it takes sacrifice, effort and much faith to make dream come to life! We are continually striving for excellence, which means that we are continually stretching and expanding our talents, efforts, and resources! Down to specific details of this Kickstarter.

Without you guys we really may never get to make our first album, or come play for you or someone you want to hear this message! But with your help and God “All things are possible!” Let’s do this!","Our main challenge will be to properly budget our funds for recording, mixing, mastering, and producing physical copies of the album.  We will be practicing these songs consistently and intensely before ever getting into the studio, so that we can spend our kickstarter money as efficiently as possible to produce the best sound, and highest quality album we possibly can.

The piece concerned a Mormon couple trying to cope with the suicide of their gay son. At the funeral they unexpectedly meet his lover, and they're faced with a reality they've long ignored, and are forced to reconcile their feelings with their beliefs. It was a deeply stirring experience for me, and for reasons I can't quite explain (and at the risk of sounding cheesy), the piece seemed to sing at me.  I set up a meeting with the playwright, Carol Lynn Pearson, and told her I wanted to turn the piece into a musical. She laughed, envisioning a kick line of dancing Mormon missionaries (this was a year before THE BOOK OF MORMON was in anyone's consciousness). I assured her that my intention was to create an intimate, dramatic piece that would serve to raise awareness for the growing and upsetting trend of youth suicides in the LGBT community. I wanted to create a show that could make a difference. Happily, she agreed to let me proceed. With Mark-Eugene Garcia, our book writer and lyricist, and composer David Rigano, FACING EAST: THE MUSICAL has taken a long trip down the development road, and has come out ready to hit the stage. We have workshopped the show twice, in Chicago and in Dallas. We've brought new team members in along the way, including our orchestrator Dan Klintworth, and musical supervisor Adam Wright.  Our show will receive it's first fully staged production in 216, but as a precursor  London shall be the first to hear the show in its new form. We're planning a concert-staging for one-night-only on the West End with some of the best talents London can offer!  But we need your help to make this happen. We truly believe our show has an important story and message to tell. We hope you'll join us on the journey to take this message to British audiences.  By supporting this campaign, you're not simply helping another show, you're joining a family, a community. You'll be the first to get inside information as the show is developed for London and beyond.  Together, through theatre, we can make a difference. ""One step at a time."" With thanks, Nathan, and the producing team (Danny Brooke, Stephen McGill, Sean Bryan, Deborah Barrigan, Joel Marvin)","Putting up any new musical is not without its hardships. In this case, we have a creative team based in the US and Canada, with talent and producers in the US and UK.   Travel is the biggest hurdle we face. In a perfect world, we'd love our creatives to all be in London with us to mount the perfect performance. Each of your donations will go a long way towards making that happen.   We are targeting an early summer performance, around Gay Pride, in a prominent theatre (which we plan to announce soon). We hope you'll join us on this incredible journey and opportunity to spread the message of this beautiful show. ",failed

The 'Greetings From' tour seeks to create public art that will capture the pride of local residents for their hometowns and spark the interest of visitors and tourists. The two artists will travel to select cities throughout the United States for a year painting murals inspired by vintage large-letter postcards. The classic “Large Letter” postcard from the 3’s-5’s features the name of a city with different images of landmarks from that particular city in each of the letters. The postcard inspired murals that will be painted by The Greetings From team will use aerosol art to showcase modern or perhaps even undiscovered landmarks from the cities they visit. Lisa and Victor will pack their city lives into an RV traveling from city to city creating their artwork. At each stop, documentary photography and insider knowledge from natives will serve as content for letters in the mural given back to the cities. Local artists and landmark businesses will be invited to participate and contribute. Relevant sponsors can be creatively incorporated into each mural as well. Sponsors also have the opportunity to advertise on the body of the RV for great exposure as the duo travels throughout the country. After each mural is complete, the documented story will be shared through social media in the form of video, photography, and blog posts. The entire project will eventually be compiled into a comprehensive publication. Greetings From Chinatown, NY 215 Mural Commitments: Artwork - In 215, a commitment to a total of 1 (ten) murals in major cities throughout the United States. Documentary Delivery - Photo and video content will be delivered within 3 days after the completion of a mural. Limited Edition Postcards - We will create vintage inspired linen postcard prints of each mural that we paint. Print Publication - At the end of the project, we are looking to put together a comprehensive publication. Greetings From Redhook, Brooklyn If you have access to a wall space in a busy location, please reach out to us and we would love to stop by your city to create a timeless piece on it!","The funding amount that we are asking for only amounts to a fraction of our yearly estimated costs. We are looking to partner with some potential sponsors as well outside of Kickstarter to help fund the overall goal. You can take a look at our website (http://greetingstour.com) for a full sponsorship deck. Any confirmed sponsors will be shared with everyone on Kickstarter.  One of the minor challenges that we will have is securing enough wall space to paint our murals. We have a network of artists all over the country, so we will definitely be able to find enough walls to paint. However, our goal is to find some of the best and most visible locations with as much traffic as possible. We also want the artwork to be accepted by the community and stay up as long as possible. Any help from the public in helping us source walls would be greatly appreciated! ",failed
